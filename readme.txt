== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are the requirements of the plugin ? =

We try to ensure that any Gantry theme and the Gantry Plugin specifically will work with any modern and secure server environment. The recommended minimum requirements are :

* WordPress 3.0 or higher
* PHP 5.2+
* MySQL 3.23 (5+ recommended)
* Apache 1.3 (2.2+ recommended)
* mod_mysql
* mod_xml
* mod_zlib

= Where are the options of the plugin ? =

The plugin itself doesn't have any options as everything is theme powered. Gantry Framework plugin is working in the background providing the functionality to the Gantry powered themes allowing them to control everything per-theme basis . You can download a basic Gantry theme from the official [Gantry Framework](http://gantry-framework.org/ "Gantry Framework") site.

= How can I test it ? =

Once you downloaded and installed Gantry Framework plugin, please download also a default theme (that is intended to be used as a basis for building your own themes) from [Gantry Framework](http://gantry-framework.org/ "Gantry Framework") site.
